"""Push/Pull's staged preview (#434): an attached, non-prism push shows the
REAL result mid-drag — the commit applied once to the model, then its cap
stretched — so the walls a split face shares merge and shorten live, as the
commit will leave them.

The property every test leans on: after any preview frame the model equals a
fresh model where the same face was committed directly at that distance. The
comparison is deliberately strong — face cycles with holes, the edge set, soft
flags and interior marks — because the bug was exactly a preview whose faces
looked right while its edges did not.

The cost side: a release inside the held interval commits the stage itself
(no second pipeline run), one stage per side of the base plane is parked for
the way back, and a slow model stages once per drag.

Headless: stub viewport + direct tool calls, as tests/test_pushpull_ux.py.
